          The first step is that careful handpicking of ripe coffee cherries,
          the first essential step in the Ethiopian coffee ceremony. Selecting

          After the beans were fully roasted the hostess would display them on a
          platter of some fashion and fan the beans sending the fantastic scent
          through the room. I believe this was a gesture for the visors to enjoy
          the aroma before going forward
